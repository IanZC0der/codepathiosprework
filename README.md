### The App I want to build

The app I have been wanting to build is an app for bookmarking/reviewing books/movies/music. As a book/movie/music enthusiastic, I need an app to explore/review
movies, books, and songs. This should be a core functionality for this app. The users should be able to create their own communities based on the content they
like.
